# Portfolio
This portfolio contain both academic and personal projects that I have worked on in the field of Data Analytics, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing 

[Project 1 Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification](https://github.com/nabeelmaklai/Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/CNN)
- Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification
- Used a labeled dataset with diverse images from different categories
Preprocessed and augmented the image data to enhance model performance
- Designed a deep CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
- Achieved a high classification accuracy of 94%
- Visualized the CNN's feature maps and explained the network's decision-making process
- Fine-tuned the model hyperparameters to optimize performance 
- Discussed challenges faced during the project and lessons learned.
