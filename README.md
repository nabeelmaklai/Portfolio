# Portfolio
This portfolio contain both academic and personal projects that I have worked on in the field of Data Analytics, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing 

[Project 1:
Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification](https://github.com/nabeelmaklai/Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/CNN)
- Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification
- Used a labeled dataset with diverse images from different categories
Preprocessed and augmented the image data to enhance model performance
- Designed a deep CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
- Achieved a high classification accuracy of 94%
- Visualized the CNN's feature maps and explained the network's decision-making process
- Fine-tuned the model hyperparameters to optimize performance 
- Discussed challenges faced during the project and lessons learned

[Project 2:
Enhanced Fake News Detection with Machine Learning and NLP](https://github.com/nabeelmaklai/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/NLP/NLP_Fake_News_Detection_Model.ipynb)
- Developed a machine learning model, incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP), to detect fake news articles from real ones
- Utilized a labeled dataset comprising news articles and their authenticity labels (0 for fake, 1 for real)
- Engineered textual features, including TF-IDF and NLP techniques, to effectively represent the content
- Explored various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to identify the most effective approach
- Evaluated the model's performance using standard metrics, achieving a high accuracy and precision in fake news detection.
- Fine-tuned model hyperparameters for improved performance
- Visualized performance metrics and confusion matrices to illustrate the model's effectiveness
- Highlighted the project's significant results, emphasizing its capability to distinguish fake news from real news


[Project 3:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a superstore's sales dataset, revealing critical insights and answering critical common business questions associated with the analysis](https://github.com/nabeelmaklai/Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/EDA)

- Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a superstore's sales dataset
- Identified and analyzed sales trends, inventory management, and opportunities for enhancing customer satisfaction
- Employed advanced data preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality and reliability
- Delivered actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and increase profitability
